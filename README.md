## Introduction!

This is a ChatGPT clone repository, a project that aims to create a conversational AI model inspired by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture. 
The clone is built using JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, and utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing and generation of responses. 
The objective of this project is to provide a foundation for building chatbot applications that can engage in human-like conversations with users.

  ## Features
  
- Conversational AI: The ChatGPT clone leverages the power of OpenAI's API to generate contextually relevant and coherent responses based on user input. It can simulate human-like conversations and provide intelligent and helpful answers.

- Real-time Interaction: Users can interact with the chatbot in real-time, receiving instant responses as they engage in conversation. The interface is designed to facilitate a smooth and seamless user experience.

# Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for the frontend and backend development.
  
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that powers the backend server.

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets used for styling and layout of the chatbot interface.

- OpenAI API: The OpenAI API is integrated into the project to provide the natural language processing capabilities for generating responses.


# Contribution Guide

- Fork the repository, create a clone and make sure that you are not working on the `MAIN BRANCH' repository!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/chatgpt-clone.git
```

```bash
cd chatgpt-clone
```

- It is not good practice to work on the `main` branch. You can create a new branch by using this command

```bash
git checkout -b {name-of-the-branch-here}
```

- Add a stream so you can sync your clone with the original repository (get the latest updates)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/anayatkhan1/chatgpt-clone.git
```

- Use this command to stay up to date with the original repository (not the fork that you made)

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

- Make your contribution too :)

- Open a Pull Request also.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
